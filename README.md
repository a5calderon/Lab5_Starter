1. I would not do a unit test for the "message" feature because this would fall under attempting to test how a feature interacts with other features--since this is not an isolated action. 

2. I would use a unit test to confirm if a message is under the set "max length" because this is a smaller and simpler check, where the input would be the length and output would be T or F. Other features would not affect this test.
